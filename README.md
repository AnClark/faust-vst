This project provides a [VST][1] plugin architecture for the [Faust][2]
programming language. The package contains the Faust architecture,
faustvst.cpp, the faust2faustvst helper script which provides a quick way to
compile a plugin, a collection of sample plugins written in Faust, and a
generic GNU Makefile for compiling and installing the plugins.

faust-vst is a port of [faust-lv2][3] to the [VST][1] plugin standard, and as
such it offers pretty much the same set of features. In particular, it
supports both instruments and effects, has an advanced voice assignment
algorithm which properly deals with multi-channel MIDI data, and provides
automatic MIDI controller assignments and MTS tuning capabilities.  Faust
sources that have been developed for faust-lv2 should just take a recompile to
make them work in exactly the same way in any VST host (and vice versa).

faust-vst has been tested and is known to work on recent Linux and Mac OS X
versions. Support for Windows should be a piece of cake, though (contributions
are welcome!). The architecture has been given some fairly thorough testing
using various open-source and commercial DAWs on both Linux and Mac OS X,
among them Ardour, Bitwig, Qtractor, Reaper and Tracktion. It appears to work
fine with each of these, but if you notice any bugs then please head over to
https://bitbucket.org/agraef/faust-vst and report them there.

Copying
=======

Like most other Faust architectures, faust-vst is licensed under the LGPL,
please check the included COPYING and COPYING.LESSER files for details. This
implies, in particular, that the architecture can be used in proprietary
software only if you also provide a means which lets users build your plugin
with a suitably modified version of the architecture. (The only practical way
to do this right now is to provide the Faust source of your plugin. If this
doesn't suit you then feel free to contact me for obtaining a commercial
license, or have a look at CCRMA's alternative vst.cpp architecture by Yan
Michalevsky which is licensed under a more liberal BSD-style license.)

Note that in order to create a working VST plugin using the faustvst.cpp
architecture, you'll also need Steinberg's VST SDK (see below). This is
proprietary software, so if you publish a plugin that is created using this
architecture then you'll also have to comply with Steinberg's license terms.
Please check the documentation accompanying the VST SDK distribution for
details.

Prerequisites
=============

To compile plugins with the faustvst.cpp architecture, you need to have Faust,
GNU make, the Boost headers, Qt4 or Qt5 (if you want to utilize the custom
plugin GUI support), and a suitable C++ compiler installed. The Makefile uses
whatever the CXX variable indicates. The faust2faustvst script uses gcc by
default, but you can change this by editing the script file. Both gcc and
clang should work out of the box, other C++ compilers may need some twiddling
with the compiler options in the Makefile and the faust2faustvst script.

Note that the examples still use the "old" a.k.a. "legacy" Faust library
modules, so they should work out of the box with both "old" Faust versions (up
to 0.9.85) and later ones featuring the "new" Faust library (anything after
0.9.85, including current git sources).

You'll also need the Steinberg SDK version 2.4 or later. A zip archive with
the latest SDK version can be found here:
http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html. There's no standard
location for these files, so you just copy them to any directory on your
system that seems appropriate. For instance:

    unzip vstsdk360_22_11_2013_build_100.zip
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/src
    sudo mv 'VST3 SDK' /usr/local/src/vstsdk

The name of the zip file and the package directory will of course vary with
the version of the SDK you downloaded; at the time of this writing, VST SDK
3.6.0 is the current version.

The faust-vst Makefile will look for the SDK files in some common locations
(including the /usr/local/src/vstsdk path suggested above) and configure
itself accordingly at build time. If it gets this wrong or cannot find the
files then you can also set the location explicitly when invoking make:

    make SDK=/path/to/the/SDK

Installation
============

Make sure that you have the VST SDK installed in an appropriate location, as
discussed above, then run `make` and `make install`. The latter will install
the compiled plugins under /usr/local/lib/vst by default; you need root access
or administrator privileges to be able to do that. Instead, you can also
install the plugins in your personal VST plugin folder (e.g., ~/.vst on
Linux):

    make install vstlibdir=~/.vst

Or you might just copy the compiled plugins (.so files on Linux) manually to
whatever directory you want to use:

    cp examples/*.so ~/.vst

Note that in the case of Mac OS X, the plugins are actually bundles (i.e.,
directories) with the `.vst` extension which need to be copied using `-R`:

    cp -R examples/*.vst ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST

But usually running just `make install` with the appropriate `vstlibdir`
should do the trick on any supported platform.

Please note that in any case this step is optional. The included plugins are
just examples which you can use to test that everything compiles ok and to
check for compatibility of the plugins with your VST host. You may want to
skip this step if you're only interested in compiling your own plugins.

For compiling your own Faust sources, only the faustvst.cpp architecture, the
accompanying faustvstqt.h header file and the faust2faustvst helper script are
needed. Chances are that you already have those if you run a recent revision
of the Faust compiler. Otherwise the `make install-faust` target of this
package provides you with a quick way to add the architecture and the helper
script to your existing Faust installation.

Both `make install` and `make install-faust` let you adjust the installation
prefix with the `prefix` make variable, and package maintainers can specify a
staging directory with the `DESTDIR` variable as usual. There's a bunch of
other variables which let you set various compilation options and installation
paths; please check the Makefile for details.

Also note that on Mac OS X, the Makefile and the faust2faustvst script will
create universal (32 and 64 bit Intel) binaries by default, which should be
usable with both 32 and 64 bit VST hosts. You can change this by adjusting the
`ARCH` variable in the Makefile and the script accordingly. E.g., setting
`ARCH` to something like `"-arch i386"` will create 32 bit Intel binaries
only, while leaving `ARCH` empty creates binaries for the default architecture
of your system (usually 64 bit these days). While some 64 bit hosts such as
Reaper will work just fine with 32 bit VST plugins, others such as Tracktion
may require 64 bit plugins for the 64 bit version of the program. Going with
the fat binaries should have you covered in either case.

Usage
=====

As already mentioned, the present implementation is based on the code of the
[faust-lv2][3] plugin architecture and provides pretty much the same set of
features, in particular: automatic controller mappings (observing the
`midi:ctrl` attributes in the Faust source), multi-channel voice assignment
for polyphonic instrument plugins (VSTi), as well as support for pitch bend
range and master tuning (RPN) messages and MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS)
messages. The `unit` attribute is also supported, but note that none of the
LV2-specific attributes of the faust-lv2 architecture are implemented right
now.

To compile your own plugins, you can use the provided faustvst.cpp
architecture with the Faust compiler like this: `faust -a faustvst.cpp
mydsp.dsp`. You then need to compile the resulting C++ source and link it
against some SDK modules to obtain a working plugin. The necessary steps are
all rather straightforward, but vary with the target platform (e.g., on OS X
you need to create a proper Mach-O bundle) and require some knowledge about
compiler and linker options as well as some VST-specific requirements.

To facilitate this process, we recommend using either the provided Makefile or
the faust2faustvst helper script. The Makefile can be used either as a
starting point for your own Faust-VST plugin projects, or you can just drop
your Faust sources into the examples directory to have them built along with
the other examples.

The faust2faustvst script is invoked as follows:

    faust2faustvst amp.dsp

This will compile `amp.dsp` using the Faust compiler and then invoke the C++
compiler on the resulting C++ code to create a working plugin. All the
necessary compiler and linker options are provided automatically, and on OS X
the script also takes care of creating a proper VST bundle.

The faust2faustvst script looks for the SDK files in some common locations.
If it doesn't find them, you can also set the proper location by editing the
beginning of the script accordingly.

The faust2faustvst script understands a number of options which correspond to
various compilation options in the Makefile; run `faust2faustvst -h` to get a
brief summary of these.

As with faust-lv2, the same architecture is used for both effect (VST) and
instrument (VSTi) plugins. For the latter, you may define the `NVOICES` macro
at build time in the same manner as with the lv2.cpp architecture. Moreover,
it is also possible to specify the maximum number of voices with the `nvoices`
meta key in the Faust source.

Please check examples/organ.dsp in the distributed sources for a simple
example of an instrument plugin. The rules for creating the voice controls
`freq`, `gain` and `gate` are the same as for the lv2.cpp architecture.
To compile an instrument plugin with the faust2faustvst script, you can
specify the maximum polyphony with the `-nvoices` option, e.g.:

    faust2faustvst -nvoices 16 organ.dsp

Or you may add a definition like the following to the beginning of your Faust
source:

    declare nvoices "16";

If both are specified then the command line option takes precedence. Using
`-nvoices 0` (or `declare nvoices "0";` in the Faust source) creates an
ordinary effect plugin without MIDI note processing. This is also the default
if none of these options are specified.

MTS Support
===========

As with faust-lv2, VST instruments created with the faustvst.cpp architecture
can be retuned using sysex messages in MTS (MIDI Tuning Standard) format. At
present, the supported formats are 1- or 2-byte octave-based tunings, please
check the faust-lv2 documentation for details on this. We also offer a program
which generates MTS messages in these formats from human-readable scale
definitions in the Scala format and stores them as Sysex (.syx) or MIDI (.mid)
files. You can find this program at https://bitbucket.org/agraef/sclsyx.

The faustvst.cpp architecture also offers the same kind of tuning control
which allows you to choose a tuning from a collection of MTS sysex files
determined at load time. If you drop some MTS sysex (.syx) files into a
special folder (~/.faust/tuning by default, or ~/Library/Faust/Tuning on the
Mac), then the `tuning` control becomes available on all faust-vst instrument
plugins which have been compiled with this option. This (automatable) control
usually takes the form of a slider displaying both the tuning number and the
basename of the corresponding sysex file. Changing the slider value adjusts
the tuning in real-time. Please check the faust-lv2 documentation for details.

GUI Support
===========

GUI support also works in the same manner as with faust-lv2. This is currently
only supported on Linux and still somewhat experimental, so expect some bugs
(check "Known Issues" below). To compile the plugins with GUI support, make
sure that you have Qt4 or Qt5 installed (the latter is recommended) and run
`make` as follows:

    make gui=1

You may also have to specify the location of your `qmake` executable, which
can be done as follows:

    make gui=1 qmake=/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake

The faust2faustvst script is run with the `-gui` option to build a GUI-enabled
plugin (you can also use `-qt4` or `-qt5` to choose a particular Qt version):

    faust2faustvst -gui amp.dsp

The script will look for a suitable `qmake` executable in some common
locations. Exactly which `qmake` will be chosen is displayed as the default
value of the `QMAKE` environment variable if you run `faust2faustvst -h`. If
`qmake` cannot be found then you'll have to set this variable accordingly,
e.g.:

    QMAKE=/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake faust2faustvst -gui amp.dsp

The script sports the same GUI-related options as the faust2lv2 script; please
check the faust-lv2 documentation for details.

Known Issues
============

Custom plugin GUIs are currently supported on Linux only. Even on Linux, Qt
GUIs are known to cause problems with some VST hosts due to library
incompatibilities and multithreading issues. Therefore custom GUIs are
disabled in Ardour and Reaper right now (for Ardour, we suggest using
faust-lv2 with Qt4 GUIs instead, these seem to work fine there). If you notice
random crashes or other issues with the host that you're using, you may either
want to run the plugins through a modular host like [Carla][] or just disable
GUI support in the plugins and use the host-provided generic GUIs instead.

[Carla]: https://github.com/falkTX/Carla

On Mac OS X some hosts don't seem to recognize the Faust-generated VST plugins
at all. This might be due to some missing (esoteric) meta data. If anyone can
shed light on this issue, please let us know, so that we can fix it. For the
time being, you can try to run the plugins through Carla or some other modular
host instead.
